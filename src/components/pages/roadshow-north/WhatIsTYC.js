            <p className="subtitle text-center">Tas Youth Convention is for grades 9-12 held each year on the weekend before Term 4 commences.
            Over the weekend we&apos;ll have sessions where we get stuck into the Bible, pray and sing
            but the rest of the time is yours to shape into a youth group retreat of your own making.
            Over the years, many young people have found TYC to be a significant point in their relationship
            with Jesus and it is our prayer that it will continue to be that for many more. We provide the talks,
            music and venue (and morning tea on Saturday and Sunday) and youth groups organise their own food and accommodation.  </p>
