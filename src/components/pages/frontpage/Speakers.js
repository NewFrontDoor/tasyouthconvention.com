                <p>Dave is married to Evthoxia and they have two boys Josh (16) and Alexis (14). They live in Margate Tasmania, along with Dave's American Staffordshire Bull Terrier (Bailey) and Alexi's Cat (Polly). Dave started out in full time ministry in the UK where he was mainly working with university students. Since then, he studied at Moore Theological College in Sydney, and for the last 9 years has been the Pastor of Summerleas Christian Church in Southern Tasmania. Dave has a passion for trying to push Christian community to the limits. In his spare time he enjoys bushwalking, listening to live music with Evthoxia, hanging out with his dog, playing guitar with Josh, watching Netflix with Alexis, collecting records, and desperately trying to earn his blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
