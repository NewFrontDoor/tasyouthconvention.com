                    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                    <p className="subtitle">The Tasmanian Youth Convention is run by a small committee of volunteers. TYC is made possible through the hard work of our local team, partnered churches and youth groups along with their leaders.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">We think Jesus is the answer and solution to the biggest questions and problems. He’s the best news anyone can hear!</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">Our central desire is to see young people in our state seriously engage with the Gospel about Jesus; to consider what it would look like to follow Him all their lives’. Our goal is to offer to them a clear, biblical picture of exactly such a life so that they can consider this.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">We draw our vision statement from the words of Jesus in Mark 8:34,35 <em>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.”</em></p>
                    <p className="subtitle">TYC exists under <a href="https://vision100.org"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Vision 100 Network</a>.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">We share their vision of gathering and resourcing a network of churches and church leaders, while raising up and training the next generation of church leaders in order to plant evangelistic, church-planting churches.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">We hope that in building up young Christians, we are establishing a future for ministry in our state.</p>

                    <h3 className="pddn-30-top">Who is responsible for my child?</h3>
                    <p className="subtitle">All youth will come to the convention as part of a group. Your child will have to be registered under a youth group that has already registered its commitment to attend. This is because, since we are a small committee that can only do so much, accommodation and food is almost entirely organised by the leaders of the groups attending.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">The youth leaders overseeing the group your child stays with is primarily responsible for their safety.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">Committee members and other volunteers on site will hold WWVP cards.</p>
                    <p className="subtitle">Tas Youth Convention is covered by public liability insurance through our connection to The Vison 100 Network.</p>

                    <h3 className="pddn-30-top">Theological Basis and Denominational Standpoint</h3>
                    <p className="subtitle">TYC aims to centre everything around God’s word. Every year we draw our theme from the books of the Bible. If you have any specific questions on our theological convictions, please email <a href="mailto:tom@tasyouthconvention.org">tom@tasyouthconvention.org</a></p>
                    <p className="subtitle">We aim to focus on what unifies us as Christians. TYC is multi-denominational event and this is represented in those that attend – we have youth coming from Reformed, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and Pentecostal Churches.</p>
